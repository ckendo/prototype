					<h2>Welcome to The Prototype</h2>
					<br>
					<p>The Science Center presents an exhibit on the design process, titled "The Prototype".</p>
					<p>From the Apple iPad, to spinning chairs, to city plazas, and to the cars we drive, the products, structures, and spaces we use in our day-to-day lives are the results of collaborative brainstorming, revisions, and many dead ends. These products of design each begin with a prototype - sketches recorded on coffee shop napkins, cardboard mockups, and blueprints.</p>
					<p>"The Prototype" focuses on the design process of the products, spaces, objects, and technology we use in our everyday lives - structures that must be realized with consideration of the three principles of design: beauty, sustainability, and utility. From areas such as engineering, industrial design, architecture, urban studies, computer science, and visual art, this exhibit showcases parts of the design process that are not usually seen by the user, focusing on the inspiration, brainstorming, collaborations, revisions, and dead ends that happen before a product, structure, or space is ever realized. This exhibit showcases the sketches, mathematics, physics, physical prototyping, 3D printing, and digital rendering and simulations, through programs such as Maya, Rhino, SketchUp, and AutoCAD, that make up this process. </p>

		            							<p>This project is an integrated computational and digital fabrication prototype for a custom high performance ceramic facade system. In designing a high performance facade, one that is tailored to the lighting conditions based on programmatic needs of a space, the additive manufacturing process has allowed for a highly optimized design with greater flexibility, variety, and possibly efficiency in construction. The Grasshopper and DIVA plug-in for Rhinoceros work concurrently to generate and assess fabrication models in terms of daylight. The MIT Media Lab was chosen as a case study and experiment for the 3D printed optimized facade due to its variability in programmatic elements within one elevation of the building. This project aims to address the implications of the additive manufacturing process on an architectural scale.</p>
												<p>The design of the facade via Grasshopper and the experimental phase of the printing developed concurrently. The extruder was reconfigured from an existing Ryobi caulking gun to efficiently extrude a special mix of porcelain and sand called CV90 made specifically in the RISD ceramics department. The most ideal mixture and consistency of the clay became a determinant in both the configuration of the extruder, as well as the design of individual components because of its structural properties and understanding the limit of the material.</p>

		            							<p>In Winter 2015, I took an introductory architecture course at RISD called Architectonics. Our first assignment was to map a physical phenomenon on our route from home to studio. I mapped potential danger by tracing continuous paths of motion, paying special attention to where these intersected with car routes, and identifying safe spaces. I worked with this concept for the entire class, which culminated in six final drawings of a bathhouse where dangerous intersections must be traversed in order to reach the suspended baths.</p>
		            							<p>The project is conceptual, as it could be considered a piece of “visionary” architecture. The process was to draft an initial phenomenon map, which we then translated into three dimensions by building a model. Then, we drew sections and cuts of the model and used those to create a piece of architecture. Because my piece is built off of intersecting planes, I ended up using a lot of basic geometry and my initial sketches are covered in quick numerical calculations.</p>

		            							<p>During construction of the Poughkeepsie Day School Middle School space, it became clear that there was a need to center the space and provide a place to gather. The open center of the wheel focuses attention on the back wall of the Da Vinci science and art space, a defining feature of the Middle School.</p>
		            							<p>The Dean of the Middle School, Laura Graceffa, worked closely with me on this book wheel project.</p>
		            							<p>The entire Middle School was converted and renovated based on collaborative design sessions with the MS faculty, MS Dean and Fielding-Nair, a school space consulting firm. The bookwheel was added to the renovation project about mid-way through construction.</p>
		            							<p>I am always trolling magazines, friends, and the web for interesting and compelling design ideas. I found the sculpture of books glued into a swinging wheel while looking at the web one evening.</p>  
		            							<p>There were a number of engineering changes made during initial construction of the wheel, having to do with the width of the lateral planking and the precise angle of the kerf on those same planks. Software was used to determine the kerf – 2.8 degrees. Cabinetry fabricators D-Cor Design created the internal core support system, to which the lateral planking was attached.</p>
		            							<p>The wheel is built out of stained and lacquered Birch Baltic plywood, and stands 82” high, 30” deep.</p> 
		            							<p>Creating the internal core to attach the planking to posed a challenge during the design process. After testing, it was determined that an internal core was need, to provide the needed tensile strength for the surface planking. Also, determining the precise kerf angle cut for the lateral planks took several rounds of testing. Making sure the wheel could fit through door openings posed another challenge, requiring the height to beg precisely calculated to allow for transport and comfortable sitting space. After observing how the books sat on the shelves at various angles, the shelving partitions were doubled to allow the books to better fill the space.</p> 
		            							<p>The bookwheel has been installed and in use at the Poughkeepsie Day School for 3 years.</p>

												<p>This proposed site-specific installation aims to provide a spatial contrast to the existing context (Historic Wing at Providence Public Library) through introducing a natural monolith, Glacier, into the humanistic space. It aims to create a meditative and immersive spatial experience where architecture and typography intersect, and to evoke an inquiry of the inner space.</p>
												<p>We constructed a series of study models to map out existing circulation and viewpoints, and worked carefully with the vantage points to formulate a relational dialogue between our installation and the site. We worked meticulously on 3D modeling and infographic diagrams in numerous iterations; we discussed over every piece of material used in physical models; we were also concerned about realistic issues including current requirements for railing, material use, lighting, etc. Our heated discussions throughout the whole process illustrated different foci in graphic design and landscape architecture in terms of our research modalities, artistic pursuit and practical concerns. Our different perspectives enriched the project on many levels, and always catalyzed new ideas and solutions.</p>
												<p>It was a great collaborative process that challenged our cross-disciplinary design thinking, and our ability to negotiate different methodologies to achieve optimal results in collaboration.</p>

												<p>This project was inspired by the desire to incorporate fun and ergonomically beneficial movement into the act of sitting.  The amount of time people spend seated during school classes or desk jobs leads to poor posture, stiffness, and back pain. This is largely because traditional chairs with horizontal seats create a 90 degree angle between the the thighs and spine, which makes maintaining the natural lumbar curve difficult.  Having identified a problem of significant importance, I started designing a type of seating that would both encourage movement and allow for a half-sitting, half-standing position.</p>
												<p>After some initial sketches and models, I created a simple mock-up out of two plywood boards with holes drilled at different heights, and a simple pivoting seat out of plywood and a dowel.  This quick mock-up allowed me to quickly test different seat heights and determine the desired range of height adjustment. Having identified the ideal sitting positions, I began the design of the side profiles, horizontal supports, and seat.</p>
												<p>The four pronged cutout pattern seen in the side profiles allows for simple manual height adjustment, by grabbing the seat and sliding it through the cutout path like a gear shifter.  The shape of the side profiles was chosen (through much experimenting in CAD) to subtly reflect the curve of the human spine.  I also made sure that the top of the profiles would not interfere with arm movement when the seat was at its lowest height. The front lateral support can be used as a footrest when the seat is high. The horizontal dowels follow the curve of the profiles, providing additional lateral support and creating more visual continuity with the profiles.The padded and upholstered seat cushion is very comfortable and provides friction to prevent sliding off the seat when it is angled.</p>

												<p>An exploration of the meaning of Body+Internet as a Wintersession project imagined by the Brown, RISD, and MIT STEAM clubs. An effort to bring together science, design and engineering to answer a question and culminate in a display. Our design process used multimodal collaboration to brainstorm, design and create our final project. The goal was to transform data into another form that is recognizable to other people and communities, exploring the trangible relationships between humans and cyberspace.</p>
												<p><blockquote>"We are fascinated by internet sensations and have created an alternative way to experience such a digital phenomena."</blockquote></p>
												<p>Internet Sensations: they are often viral, powerful, and somewhat irrational. Individual expressions can generate a buzz capable of influencing the collective attention of Internet users - what they will like, do, and care about. We have created an alternate way to experience such a digital phenomena. By transforming the popularity of Twitter hashtags into haptic feedback, we provide a way to physically interact with the Internet.</p>
												<!--<img src="img/modal/internet-sensations/1.jpg">-->

												<p>The initial concept was to measure biologic signals as evidence of the Internet's physical presence. The first rendition was a listening station. Twitter hashtags were translated into a repeating beat whose rate reflected teh hashtag's changing popularity on the Internet. The audience tapped into the pulse of the Internet around the selected hashtag using a stethoscope, similar to a doctor ausculating heart sounds.</p>

												<img src="img/modal/internet-sensations/version1.jpg">
												<p class = "description">Version 1 <br>Listening to the pulse of the Internet</p>

												<p>The inadvertent discovery of a haptic feedback mechanism from the sound wave passing through the transducer into the listening stand inspired the sound version of the product. In order to emphasize a physical and tactile nature of the Internet, the Internet Sensations Wand was created.</p>
												<p><blockquote>"The vibration intensity is determined by the popularity of certain hashtags. Users may search for any hashtag they wish, and then enjoy that hashtag's popularity through haptic feedback."</blockquote></p>
												
												<p>The Internet played a major role in the design and collaboration that brought the idea to product. The web-based conferencing tools, Skype and FaceTime, and project management apps, Slack and Google Drive, helped overcome the different physical locations and time availability of the team members. The code to translate trending #hashtags into a rhythm was written in Python code and accessed through a Twitter API.</p>

												<p>Photographic Relief is an experimental process generating 3D reliefs from 2D image. The process combining Rhino's (3D modeling program) height field function to generating 3D surface and UV flatbed printer to apply color. This example demonstrates the process of turn photo of the Rocky Mountain into a 3D relief. With further development, such technique could be applied in art and design project as well as data visualization.</p>

												<p>The attached drawings are concept renderings for a large scale sculpture. The project began on paper, then moved into Rhino for a greater realization of scale and the surrounding space. Once the concept reached a stage of development where the forms needed to be made, I started working with wood to test scale, color, and surface, and to see the forms interacting in real space. The work in prototyping is ongoing, as the central element - the disk - is in its early stages. The work as a whole is an artistic representation of an unseeable moment.</p>

												<p>The purpose of the project is to design a simple, intuitive, and durable musical toy for kids within the age group of 7-­12. The goal for the design is to stimulate their creativity and curiosity in seeking further understanding of music.</p>
												<p>Before the design process, I spent some time researching the award-winning and bestselling toys within the age group. After pinpointing some common characteristics of these toys, I wanted to make this a wearable and transformable musical toy that also has DIY (do-it-yourself) features.</p>
												<p>This project has taught me the importance of being a humble designer, to be open-minded, look beyond myself and seek the knowledge of others. Ultimately, product design is to design for people, design for an outcome.</p>
