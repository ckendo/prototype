					<h2>Welcome to The Prototype</h2>
					<p>The Science Center presents an exhibit on the design process, titled "The Prototype".</p>
					<p>From the Apple iPad, to spinning chairs, to city plazas, and to the cars we drive, the products, structures, and spaces we use in our day-to-day lives are the results of collaborative brainstorming, revisions, and many dead ends. These products of design each begin with a prototype - sketches recorded on coffee shop napkins, cardboard mockups, and blueprints.</p>
					<p>"The Prototype" focuses on the design process of the products, spaces, objects, and technology we use in our everyday lives - structures that must be realized with consideration of the three principles of design: beauty, sustainability, and utility. From areas such as engineering, industrial design, architecture, urban studies, computer science, and visual art, this exhibit showcases parts of the design process that are not usually seen by the user, focusing on the inspiration, brainstorming, collaborations, revisions, and dead ends that happen before a product, structure, or space is ever realized. This exhibit showcases the sketches, mathematics, physics, physical prototyping, 3D printing, and digital rendering and simulations, through programs such as Maya, Rhino, SketchUp, and AutoCAD, that make up this process. </p>

			<p> USE MASONRY FOR DYNAMIC LAYOUT. COULD USE PHP DATABASE BUT MAYBE NOT NEEDED. SEE CAROLINE BADGELY's GD EXHIBIT FOR RISD MUSEUM + RISD GRAD EXHIBIT FOR INSPIRATION. MAYBE USE BOOTSTRAP TOO. CAN PROBABLY JUST DO IN HTML/CSS/JQUERY! LOADING effects for scroll down to populate. Maybe loading % counter for initial load??</p>
